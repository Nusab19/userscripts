All the userscripts that I use to make my browsing life easier

## What is a userscript?

"A **userscript** (or **user script**) is a program, usually written in [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), for modifying web pages to augment browsing. Uses include adding shortcut buttons and keyboard shortcuts, controlling playback speeds, adding features to sites, and enhancing the browsing history." \[[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript)\]

## How to use userscripts?

Use extensions like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) to use the scripts. Go to the specific script you want to install. Then click the "Raw" button, it'll take you to the installation page. (if you have tampermonkey installed)
