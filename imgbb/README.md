# imgBB

## pasteFromClipboard

This script lets you paste the image without needing to drag or manually upload the image. You can just `ctrl+v` or paste from your clipboard. And it'll directly take you to the uploaded image link.

## Why?

Recently I've been using imgbb for uploading images. (memes, random stuff etc.)
But each time, I had to either drag the image or click and select the file manually. That's annoying.

Sometimes I just have the image in my clipboard. I don't want to `Save it > Drag It > Go to uploaded page > Get direct Link`

That's why I just wrote a userscript for my need. You can:

- Paste image directly from your clipboard (`ctrl+v`) [ or `win+v` then select the image ]
- It'll directly take you to the exact image url
- And, **it'll copy the main image url in your clipboard** ðŸ˜€
